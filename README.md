The project was broken into two parts with Part one showing the markers on a single layer map.  Part two provides two options for a map view and includes a tectonic plates overlay.
The folder structure is identical in both parts and mirrors the initial folder structure presented in the original file download for the assignment.  There was no specific mention of linking
the files to Github pages, but that can be added if necessary.
